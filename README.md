**LearnARF** is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) application which uses Google's [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar) to spawn 3D models into the real world. Additionally, it uses the [Sceneform SDK](https://github.com/google-ar/sceneform-android-sdk) to make it easier to handle 3D models.

## Prerequisites

* To be able to run this app, make sure your phone has official support for Google's ARCore. Check [this](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices) list to find out.

* Make sure to have the **Flutter Framework** installed. You can install it by visiting their [official site](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).



Here is how to add 3D models to the real world:
